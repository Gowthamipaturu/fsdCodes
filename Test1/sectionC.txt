Section C: Bonus Question (10 marks)
Explain the concept of React state and how it differs from props.

#######Answer#########

States:
States are used to manipulate the data/dom(virtual dom).
Props:
Props are used to pass the data from one component(Parent Component) to another component(Child Component).
Diff b/w States & Props:
The key difference between state and props is that state is managed within a component, while props are passed from a parent component to a child component. State is used to manage internal component data, while props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

Explain the difference between for and for...in loops in JavaScript. When would you use each one?

**********Answer******
If we need to run the same code repeatedly, each time with a different value we use loops.

For Loop:
Syntax for for loop:
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Expression 1: Sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 0).
Expression 2: Defines the condition for the loop to run (Ex: i<=5).
Expression 3: Increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

For In Loop:
Syntax for for(in):
for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}
The for in loop iterates over a object
Each iteration returns a key
The key is used to access the value of the key

For Of Loop:
It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more.
Syntax for for(of):
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}
variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. Variable can be declared with const, let, or var.
iterable - An object that has iterable properties.

For loop will be used everywhere in looping. ForIn/For of will be used in arrays when we need index values & Objects with particular key values.
