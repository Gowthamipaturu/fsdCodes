React Notes

Why React????
**When we will do the project using React, the webpage won't be refresh for everytime while going to one page to another
**React will use only one html page & update all the content in single page only.
**React will use Virtual Dom, html uses real Dom.
**Real dom means, the content/code everything we can see. If we need to search for the single key/content, the page will be reloaded/refresh everytime.
**Virtual dom means, the content/code have many files in backend. When we search for the key/content, process will be done in backend & updates the content without reloading the page.
****Advantage of React is 
#########Can do single page applications
#########Build the code in single page, will convert it into html,Css & Javascript 
*****React Structure:
#######We have Public & Src Folders
#######In public folder, will have html file(index.html), favicon.ico, logo etc.,
#######JQuery - Before react we were using JQuery to send/receive data using Id. Get element by Id using inner html, get element by Id using outer html.
#######Rending means data sending/displaying
####### In Src folder, app.css, app.js, app.test.js, index.css, index.js,logo etc.,
#######index.html will get the data from index.js, using "root.render"
#######We have one default component in src folder, i.e., App.
